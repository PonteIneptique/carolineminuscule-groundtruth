transcription-guidelines: >
    In general this meant deciding between diplomatic transcription (i.e. sticking to what it says on the page) and gently modernized features (i.e. reinterpreting medieval signs into modern equivalents) with a view to specific categories. Read on for a summary of the rules and the respective rationale behind them.
    
    SUMMARY
    
    PUNCTUATION
    
        Modern: medieval punctuation is transcribed with modern equivalents; punctus elevatus transcribed as semicolon
    
    CAPITALIZATION
    
        Diplomatic: Original capitalization retained
    
    ABBREVIATIONS
    
        Diplomatic where possible: Retain abbreviations and render glyphs as opposed to expanded versions where possible
        
    SPACING
    
        Diplomatic: Preserve manuscript spacing, i.e. give diplomatic transcription
    
    NUMBERS
    
        Diplomatic: retain original version of both Roman and Arabic numerals'
