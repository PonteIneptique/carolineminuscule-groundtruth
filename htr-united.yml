transcription-guidelines: "In general this meant deciding between diplomatic transcription\
  \ (i.e. sticking to what it says on the page) and gently modernized features (i.e.\
  \ reinterpreting medieval signs into modern equivalents) with a view to specific\
  \ categories. Read on for a summary of the rules and the respective rationale behind\
  \ them.\nSUMMARY\nPUNCTUATION\n\n    Modern: medieval punctuation is transcribed\
  \ with modern equivalents; punctus elevatus transcribed as semicolon\n\nCAPITALIZATION\n\
  \n    Diplomatic: Original capitalization retained\n\nABBREVIATIONS\n\n    Diplomatic\
  \ where possible: Retain abbreviations and render glyphs as opposed to expanded\
  \ versions where possible\n    \nSPACING\n\n    Diplomatic: Preserve manuscript\
  \ spacing, i.e. give diplomatic transcription\n\nNUMBERS\n\n    Diplomatic: retain\
  \ original version of both Roman and Arabic numerals'"
